### Hi there 👋

🔭 I constantly work on levelling my skills up as a software tester to the perfection. I am searching for the job in the testing field, whereas due to the fact I am not working as a software tester for the time being, I take courses all the time not to forget skills I have learnt.

:sweat_drops: At present I am working on mastering Postman.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on new projects in a new company.

⚡ Fun fact: I love playing drums (still learning..... 😉 ).
