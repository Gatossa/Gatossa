### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I constantly work on levelling my skills up as a software tester to the perfection. I am searching for the job in the testing field, whereas due to the fact I am not working as a software tester for the time being, I take courses all the time not to forget skills I have learnt.

:sweat_drops: At present I am working on mastering JavaScript and consequently Cypress together with Playwright.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on new projects in a new company.

âš¡ Fun fact: I love playing drums (still learning..... ðŸ˜‰ ).
